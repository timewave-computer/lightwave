# SP1-Tendermint ZK Light-Client operator for Valence
This repository contains a ZK prover that generates and submits SP1-Tendermint light client proofs
to our coprocessor. The service maintains a chain of proofs that verify the execution state
of the Tendermint network, committing both the block height and app hash for each
verified block.

# (Re-)Initialization
Most ZK Light Clients don't maintain the full finality proof history for all blocks.
Because of this we have a fallback / re-initialization strategy, that we can use in case our prover goes 
down for an extended period.

In order to leverage the strategy, run the following sequence of commands:

```shell
make build-circuits
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is extremely important to dump the latest elf before generating the circuits.
> If you use the wrong elfs for the circuit generation, then the vks might be invalid
> and proof verification might fail.

To start the service:
```shell
make run
```

To continue an existing service with a valid state db:
```shell
make continue
```

# System Architecture
The system consists of three main components that work together to provide ZK light client proofs:

## Service
The service is the main orchestrator that:
- Calls the Tendermint prover to generate proofs
- Implements recursive proof verification
- Maintains state of the most recent recursive proof
- In the first round, verifies only the proof at the trusted height
- In subsequent rounds, verifies both the current Tendermint proof and the previous recursive proof
- Updates its state with each new recursive proof
- Commits block height and app hash for each verified block

## SP1-Tendermint
This service depends on [SP1-Tendermint](https://github.com/timewave-computer/sp1-tendermint). SP1-Tendermint is a Tendermint ZK Light Client that can be used
to cryptographically prove the correctness of the consensus protocol. The goal is to obtain trusted roots for a given block so that we can
verify state and events that occurred within that block, without having to trust an external service (relayer).

## Recursion
The recursion crate contains the circuit code that:
- Verifies Tendermint proof
- Implements the recursive verification logic
- Ensures the chain of proofs is valid and connected
- Maintains the security properties of the light client protocol
- Verifies the app hash and block height for each block

## Wrapper
The wrapper crate contains the circuit code that:
- Verifies the Recursion proof
- Commits the same public outputs as the Recursion proof

The Wrapper circuit is necessary because we cannot recursively verify the same circuit within itself - this would require deriving the verifying key inside the circuit, which is not possible. Instead, we use a separate wrapper circuit that verifies the recursive proof and maintains the same security properties.

## Verification Logic
In order to be able to generate the first valid proof using our circuit, one has to obtain a valid Tendermint proof for our trusted checkpoint.
The trusted checkpoint is a pair of Root, Height that we know is valid and this is the only trust assumption in the protocol.

Moving forward every new proof will be verified against a valid previous proof, e.g. we always have to make a transition from one of the previous
valid Tendermint checkpoints to a new checkpoint.

For our Valence MVP we expose only the app hash and block height, because that is all we need to verify stored values in Smart Contracts on the Tendermint chain.
